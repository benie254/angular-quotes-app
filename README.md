## Description
The app is simple and straightforward. Users can read their favorite quotes, see who posted it, and when. They can also toggle show/hide functionalities, such as the upvote, downvote, and delete. Users can add their favorite quotes through a form, which has three required fileds: Quote Author, Quote, and Name (the user's name).
